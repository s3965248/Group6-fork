								<h2>Detailed Description - Plans and Progress</h2>
								<h3>The story of our project:</h3>
								<h4>How it began:</h4>
								<p>The idea for our project was first thought of by one of our team members (Anna) for the assignment project idea section of Assignment 1. Anna had this idea because she enjoys growing house plants and various succulents but struggled with the cost of buying plants from nurseries as well as the difficulty of finding plants in local nurseries or having to get them shipped. She knew that many plants are easy to propagate and frequently gave away cuttings to her friends, so that they could grow their own. This gave her the idea to provide likeminded people with a platform to trade plants, seedlings and propagations to benefit everyone involved.</p>
								<h4>How it has progressed:</h4>
								<p>Through assignments 2 and 3 we have been able to expand on exactly what we want our application to do (functionality) and how we plan on doing it.  We’ve also divided the functionality of our application into 2 releases as well as determining how we want it look (design/colour scheme). We have been able to do more in depth research on the tools, technologies, and skills needed to create the application.</p>

								</section>
								<h3>What the project will do:</h3>
								<p>Our project will provide people with an interest in growing plants with a platform to trade cuttings and seedlings with likeminded people in their local communities. This will save people money as well as providing people with a chance to meet people locally with the same interests. We hope to create an application that is easy to use while keeping people’s private information safe./<p>
								<p>The key features we plan on having done by the submission deadline are:</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>A Login page – A page for the user to sign in using their e-mail address and password or alternatively sign up using the sign-up page by entering an e-mail address, username, and password.</li>
										<li>A Pofile page – Our plan is for this include a few details about the user as well as a list of the plants they have available.</li>
										<li>A form where users can list plants with tags – This page will allow the user to enter the details of each individual plant they have available, and it will allow them to add tags (location and plant-type) to make them easier for other users to find.</li>
										<li>Listings page – This page should provide a user with a list of plants available near their location. The user can choose to contact other users from the listings to enquire about a plant.</li>
										<li>Database to populate this info to Listings page – We plan to incorporate a database to store the information added by users through the form to be displayed in the listings page for all users to see.</li>
										<li>A working app from this created on React Native – we plan to use React Native to make the app useable on all platforms.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>How we will do it:</h3>
								<p>We plan to have two members of our team take charge of the deliverable portion of our project (the app prototype) with the rest of the members helping with smaller parts where needed and creating the plan and wireframes etc. We have decided to assign Jordan as the backend developer which in the case of our current project means creating the database required for the listings page of our application, which he plans to do using the programming language Java. Matthew has been assigned the role of the frontend developer for our project. This includes creating the design and format of the application which they plan to do using HTML and CSS. Anna has been assigned the role of UI/UX designer which mainly involves her creating the wireframe for our project (to create a visual idea to show to testers as well as to help Matthew in the actual creation of the app).</p>
								<p>Our plan consists of 6 stages:</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Stage 1 (written parts of report): The first stage is one of the most important stages as it will shape what we will be doing in every other stage and how we will do it. We will decide and plan exactly what we believe we can accomplish in the limited time frame to get the best result possible. This stage will consist of writing the report which will mainly consist of the description of our project.</li>
										<li>Stage 2 (research/website creation): In this stage each member of our team will research programs/coding languages/frameworks/etc. they will need to know to get their tasks done. In this stage the initial pages and structure of our website will also be created and the design and look of the website will begin to take shape.</li>
										<li>Stage 3 (app creation – login page): Stage 3 of our plan will focus on creating the sign-in/sign-up page of our app.</li>
										<li>Stage 4 (app creation – profile page): Stage 4 of our plan will focus on creating the profile page of our app.</li>
										<li>Stage 5 (app creation – listings page/database): Stage 5 of our plan will focus on creating the listings page which will also include a form to add listings to the page. This stage of the plan also includes creating a database to display this information and will therefore involve the incorporation of the database into the project.</li>
										<li>Stage 6 (app creation and testing – React Native): In this stage of our plan our app should be finished and ready for React Native to be added and tested. Testing will be done using the app and the wireframe which will include the entire release 1 functionality.</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Changes made to the project plan:</h3>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>We had originally hope to use React Native to turn Plantr into an application native to both IOS and Android. Unfortunately, we’ve found that with the limited time we given to create the deliverables for this assignment we will be unable to incorporate React Native into our project.</li>
										<li>Due to in part Jordans brief absence because of contracting COVID 19 and his struggle to get the backend working, Matthew also took on an attempt at the backend. Jordan was working on creating the backend using Java while Matthew was attempting it using MySQL and JavaScript.</li>
										<li>In the last week of the project, we ended up using Jordan’s backend program and having Matthew create the frontend (back to the original plan). Unfortunately, the functional code will not work on the GitHub page as GitHub won’t host dynamic websites. However, the functional app will be displayed in the presentation video for assignment 5.</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Individual Weekly Progress Reports:</h3>
								<h4>Week 8 progress (18th JUL – 24th JUL):</h4>
								<p>This week was spent planning and dividing work between team members in the most efficient way. Having mostly decided on the functionality and our dream for our project we had to look at it more realistically in accordance with our current abilities and knowledge in creating applications.</p>
								<p>In the first week the focus of our team was on getting the written parts of the assignment report done, proofread, and added to the report document in Microsoft Teams so that we could later have our complete and undivided attention on the coding of our app and the writing and filming of our presentation.</p>

								</section>
								<h4>Week 9 progress (25th JUL – 31st JUL):</h4>
								<p>This week team members studied coding languages and programs that can be used to create our app prototype.  Team members were also writing, proofreading, and editing their assigned written sections of the report.</p>
								<h5>Shannon:</h5>
								<p>This week Shannon wrote the ‘Testing’ section of the report and created a form to be filled out by testers later when the app was ready for testing.</p>
								<p>In our teams’ initial plan, we had wanted to use React Native to make our app accessible on all platforms. However, this week team member Shannon discovered that implementing React Native into our app development won’t be possible in the limited time that we have. React Native requires intermediate Java which none of the team members have yet. On a more positive note, Shannon did learn how to use Trelby, a free open-source script writing program, to produce a professional looking script for the presentation (assignment 5).  They were able to write up a very detailed and perfect formatted draft script for the rest of the team to look over and provide feedback.</p>
								<h5>Anna:</h5>
								<p>This week Anna wrote the ‘Project Overview’ section which will be proofread and edited by Shannon and the ‘Risks’ section of the report which will be proofread and edited by Shannon. All members of the group were also expected to add to this section whenever they run into risks not predicted by Anna.</p>
								<p>Anna also did extensive research on how to create a wireframe using Adobe XD, which she decided to use since we are lucky to be provided with access to the program through RMIT. She has been practicing methods found through her research and plans to start on the initial draft of the app's wireframe in the next week.</p>
								<h5>Jordan:</h5>
								<p>This week Jordan wrote the ‘Group Processes’ section which will be proofread and edited by Anna and the ‘Scope and Limits’ section of the report which will be proofread and edited by Marah. However, throughout week 9 Jordan’s focus was on researching how to integrate Java into the backend of our project. Jordan has a little bit of prior knowledge with writing Java code but needs to refresh his memory and investigate databases and how to integrate them into our app.</p>
								<h5>Matthew:</h5>
								<p>This week Matthew wrote the ‘Aims’ section which will be proofread and edited by Marah and the ‘Group Processes and Communications’ section of the report which will also be proofread and edited by Marah.</p>
								<p>Matthew also began research on front-end programming and plans to begin coding as soon as they feel confident enough to create an exceptional result.</p>
								<h5>Marah:</h5>
								<p>This week Marah wrote the ‘Skills and Jobs’ section of the report which will be proofread and edited by Shannon. She also began writing the ‘Plans and Progress’ section of the report which she will add to every week with the help of the rest of the team members who will give week updates on their progress.</p>
								<p>Marah also began work on the website for the report. She created the separate pages needed and is doing on research on CSS coding in hopes of making the website appear more professional and polished than it was in the last assignment.</p>

								<h4>Week 10 progress (1st AUG – 7th AUG):</h4>
								<h5>Shannon:</h5>
								<p>This week Shannon was focused on facilitating communication between a couple of group members. This was due to being unable to contact Jordan who we later found out had become ill with COVID 19. At this point in the course there are many competing demands which is why it is very important to manage workflows well. Shannon also proofread and edited the written parts of the report assigned to them throughout the week.</p>
								<h5>Anna:</h5>
								<p>Anna began work on the app’s wireframe in week 10. She watched many tutorials on Adobe XD as well as looking at examples of apps for inspiration on the design and layout for our app. She hopes to have the initial wireframe ready for feedback from the rest of the group by the beginning of next week.</p>
								<h5>Jordan:</h5>
								<p>Jordan created the backend code for the project using Java this week. However, he is still struggling with figuring out how to integrate it with the HTML and CSS code written by Matthew as the frontend of the app. Jordan continued to research how to rewrite his code to work with the rest of the code for the app.</p>
								<h5>Matthew:</h5>
								<p>This week Matthew began work on the frontend programming of the application. Unfortunately, because of unforeseen circumstances (Jordans brief disappearance due to health issues), they also began work on backend programming for the app.</p>
								<h5>Marah:</h5>
								<p>Marah began writing the ‘Timeframe’ section and continued to make additions to the ‘Plans and Progress’ section of the report. She also proofread and editing the sections of the report that were assigned to her the previous week. Marah was also involved in facilitating communication between members of the group as well as discussing and planning what to do in case there is no response from the member of the group who was unreachable.</p>
								<p>Additionally, Marah experimented with new design features she could add to the group’s web page including but not limited to, customised scrollbar, gradient background colours, and the parallax scrolling feature.</p>

								<h4>Week 11 progress (8th AUG – 14th AUG):</h4>
								<h5>Shannon:</h5>
								<p>This week Shannon edited the ‘Aims’, ‘Risks’, and ‘Skills and Jobs’ sections of the report to confirm all sections have been proofread, edited, and are ready for submission. They also discussed web design with Marah, who wanted feedback on innovative elements she had created for the group web page.</p>
								<h5>Anna:</h5>
								<p>Anna finalised the apps wireframe this week, applying the feedback she received from the rest of the group about improvements that could be made to make the app more appealing and functional. She also began writing the ‘Career Plans’ section of the report which was postponed until this week as we were waiting for feedback from Assignment 2.</p>
								<h5>Jordan:</h5>
								<p>Jordan applied a servlet (A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model) (“What Is a Servlet? - The Java EE 5 Tutorial - Oracle”) to work on a client side but is having issues with compiling the code to work on the server side.</p>
								<h5>Matthew:</h5>
								<p>Due to the issues with Jordan’s absence Matthew started making a database and server using Express (Express is a JavaScript framework that aids the development of web servers and web APIs) and Pug (formerly known as Jade; a templating language for web pages with dynamic values). Unfortunately, they have struggled with this as they’ve never used Jade and have never made a database before. However, they’ve enjoyed learning how to use these tools and have found it to be a fun challenge.</p>
								<h5>Marah:</h5>
								<p>During week 11 Marah wrote the ‘Roles’ section of the report since Jordan failed to write due to his sudden illness, this section will be proofread and edited by Shannon. Marah also finished writing the ‘Timeframe’ section and had to rewrite the ‘Aims’ section due to it being unfinished by Matthew who was too busy with frontend development of the app to rewrite it. Both these sections will be proofread and edited by Shannon. Furthermore, Marah edited the ‘Scope and Limits’ section of the report which had been overlooked previously.</p>
								<p>Marah also began adding her written section of the report to the website, this included the ‘Skills and Jobs’ and the formatting of the ‘Timeframe’, ‘Aims’, and ‘Roles’ pages to prepare for adding in the written parts once they have been proofread and edited.</p>

								<h4>Week 12 progress (15th AUG – 21st AUG):</h4>
								<h5>Shannon:</h5>
								<p>In the final week of the assignment Shannon filmed the presentation video, which we delayed so long because we were waiting for feedback on our draft script which we sadly ultimately never received. Unfortunately, this with the addition of the sudden illness of the group member who was originally supposed to film the presentation, the quality of the recording suffered greatly. Furthermore, Shannon’s child was ill which meant they were unable to organise filming the way they had planned. Instead, their child, former partner, and themselves had to shoot the video on Shannon’s iPhone. To deal with the challenges involved, they tried to emphasise their diction to at least make the quality of the audio as interesting as possible. The video was filmed with a blank background and with plenty of crossover between clips, to give Anna (who will be editing the video) the most possible material to work with.</p>
								<p>On top of filming the video for the presentation Shannon also managed to add their written section of the report to the group’s web page which includes the ‘Team profile’, ‘Project Description – Overview’, ‘Testing’, and the ‘Tools and Technologies’ pages.</p>
								<h5>Anna:</h5>
								<p>For Anna the final week of Assignment 3 mainly consisted of editing the presentation video for Assignment 5. She did this using Adobe Premier to stitch together the clips, filmed by Shannon, as well as the recordings of the application, filmed by Jordan. She also uploaded her written parts to the group webpage and will be uploading the presentation as well once it’s finished and the rest of the group has given feedback.</p>
								<h5>Jordan:</h5>
								<p>This week Jordan finished up the Java code for our web-based application and began working on finalising the HTML and CSS to match the wireframe created by Anna. He also added his written sections to the group’s webpage.</p>
								<h5>Matthew:</h5>
								<p>The final week of the assignment had Matthew working on getting the login working with cookies. They worked with many different middleware, and they had to learn what terminal commands to use and had to brush up on JavaScript. Matthew continued creating the frontend this week with the help of Jordan. Lastly, Matthew added their written parts to the group webpage.</p>
								<h5>Marah:</h5>
								<p>In the final week, Marah had many responsibilities. She oversaw finalising the website, making sure that everything was functional and looked good and that all sections had been added and were well organised.</p>
								<p>Marah also had to finish up the ‘Plans and Progress’ section according to the team’s final updates for what they did in the final week of the assignment. She also had to write the ‘Tools’ section, specifically commenting on the GitHub trail once all sections and final changes were made to the website.</p>
