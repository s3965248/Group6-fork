								<h3>Testing Plan</h3>
								<p>Testing is vital at all stages of product development, to ensure that minimal time and resources are dedicated to features or ideas that prove unappealing to key demographics. Testing can be performed in several ways that can broadly be grouped into two categories: tests performed by humans (interviews, focus groups and user testing); and those performed by software (increasingly performed using deep learning) (Gao 2016; Li et al. 2019).</p>
								<p>The app, Plantr, will be tested during this project using a wireframe of Version 1. This will be shown to 10-15 people in the key demographic of people aged 18-35 who own at least one indoor plant. They will be invited to give feedback, using a Likert scale, on the concept, design and features. They will also be given the opportunity to provide general written feedback. This feedback will then be summarized and presented to the team to shape the final deliverables submitted for Assignment 3.</p>
								<p>If this project were to be fully developed across a 15-week timeframe, we would also perform a round of user-testing once the protype was developed. The feedback from this session would be implemented in the development of Version 1 of Plantr. </p>

								<h3>Testing Tools</h3>
								<p>We created a feedback form, using Likert scales. This was distributed for user testing along with the wireframe.</p>
