								<h2>Shared Team Reflection</h2>
								<p>Our teamwork in this assignment was definitely an improvement on that in the last assignment. We improved our organisation by beginning the assignment with a detailed list of every task that needed to be completed, which meant that we had a good understanding of the scope of the task from the outset and helped us set a suitable pace. We also fine-tuned our communication by adding a separate Teams channel for each major task (e.g. Written report, presentation, deliverables, website), this improved both communication and focus. We also found that having a formalised process for people to pass on any tasks that were overwhelming or couldn’t be done due to illness etc meant that tasks were all completed on time.  </p>
								<p>There was, as always, still room for improvement. We found that we still had some issues with communication outside of group meetings, with a low level of responsiveness. A formal process around this (such as everyone needs to respond with at least an emoji to each post on Teams) would help address this. Some team mates also felt that tasks were too fragmented and would have preferred instead to have ‘ownership’ over one of the assignments. One of our crucial issues in this project was that not everyone felt motivated to contribute to record-keeping tasks, which were needed to, in turn, complete larger sections of the written report. In the future, this could perhaps be addressed by this information being reported verbally in the meetings.</p>
								<p>Surprisingly, we found that feedback (both SparkPlus and formative feedback on one another’s writing) made the team stronger. We gained a better understanding of each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which helped us to assign tasks to the right person and to know when to check up on each other. We were also all pleasantly surprised at people stepping up to complete a task that someone else couldn’t due to illness or other commitments. Finally, we were surprised at the continuing commitment of our team, as people remained committed to showing up to the bi-weekly meetings. <p>
								<p>We have all learned valuable lessons about good group-work practices. We’ve found that poor communication or lack of communication creates tension and uncertainty. This can have a negative effect on productivity and cohesion. We also found that it was an ongoing process to develop communication practices that worked for our particular group members. Speaking more broadly, we also found that planning the project in detail from the outset is crucial to success. When there is a plan in place, it allows for more agile responses to challenges because the task itself is already known by all group members.<p>


								<h2>Marah's Reflection</h2>
								<p>During the last assignment we struggled with keeping each other in the loop and making sure that everyone was able to get their work done on time which we addressed this time by assigning tasks and deadlines right at the beginning and checking that everything was getting done frequently during our meetings. Team members were also more prepared and eager to participate and volunteer to take on work when needed. I felt that we worked much better as a team during this assignment since we had gotten to know each other a little better and weren’t complete strangers anymore. </p>
								<p>Unfortunately, we had an issue with communication outside of group meetings just like we did during the previous assignment. Some members of our group were close to impossible to reach outside of meeting times, which was incredibly frustrating, especially when there was an issue that could only be addressed by them. </p>
								<p>I was surprised at how understanding and happy to help the entire group was when another team member was unable to finish a task, due to illness or any other issues that came up. I also learned that lack of communication can create tension with other members of the group because it can be incredibly stressful not knowing what’s going on, especially when it’s a crucial task, close to the submission deadline. </p>

								<h2>Jordan's Reflection</h2>
								<p>This assignment I felt that, as a group, we were much more organised from the start; having a clear timeline and deadlines for all members. I found that, because of this, the project got started much quicker than the last assignment. I also felt like we were much better as a team all around with everyone ready to get things done from the start and no one hesitating to take on work or help other team members. </p>
								<p>Unfortunately, we still struggled with communication and the use of teams this assignment. I felt like it was a lot more efficient but at the same time more communication was needed between team members to keep everyone up to date on what is going on. </p>
								<p>I was surprised that no team member was hesitant when taking on extra work, everyone was incredibly involved, and I felt that there was no hesitation in helping other team members from anyone. As a team we have grown from the last assingment and have all pulled together to get this assignment done. </p>

								<h2>Shannon's Reflection</h2>
								<p>This assignment certainly saw more involvement by all group members, giving the project more forward momentum. Having a clear list of every task that needed to be done, no matter how big or small, and assigning these tasks at the beginning of the project helped keep everyone on track. We also formalised a process for people to hand off tasks that they couldn’t complete. </p>
								<p>There was, however, still room for improvement in our processes. A couple of tasks that required ongoing input from all team-members often were left undone, as they were perceived to be ‘small’ tasks. However, these small updates were necessary for some group members to write large sections of the report and did need more follow-through from all team-mates for that to be possible. </p>
								<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how well everyone took feedback (both SparkPlus and ad hoc feedback). This level of accountability and honesty about our strengths and weaknesses really allowed for a significant amount of growth as a team. I have previously been hesitant about giving such straightforward feedback, but I have learned from this team that it can actually help a team grow stronger; if it is given in a constructive manner that also acknowledges people’s strengths. </p>

								<h2>Matthew's Reflection</h2>
								<p>Assignment 3 was much more challenging than the last 2 assignments (as it should be), it focused more on how the team worked together and playing to each member’s strengths while working around each member’s weaknesses. </p>
								<p>We were able to talk and work out a much more thorough timeline of when each part needed to be done by. We did try to follow the timeline to the best of our abilities and when something went off course, we would talk to the group to try and get it back on track with the timeline. We needed to make more solid roles for each team member and have them bleed-over in case a member cannot continue or needs help. </p>
								<p>This team works together to fix problems instead of leaving one person to clean it up. Everyone took feedback well and is growing from the feedback. Every member’s input matters and we all figure out a plan that makes each member’s skills fit in. What I've taken from working in this group is not to doubt my skills too much and to continue growing them, also that communication can be easy if all members want to work together and can be professional about it. </p>

								<h2>Anna's Reflection</h2>
								<p>I found that for Assignment 3, our group was more organized as we had mapped out all the tasks needed for the project and assigned them early on. I believe that we were also able to communicate more effectively by creating multiple Microsoft Teams channels for the multiple parts that were required of the assignment.</p>
								<p>I think for future projects it might be better to assign each person to one part of the assignment (e.g., either the app development, report writing or presentation), instead of having everyone working on each part. I think this method could be more effective as it allows team members to focus on their part, while everyone doing small tasks and putting it all together can get a bit tedious. </p>
								<p>What I found surprising about our group is that all the team members raised their hand to do a share of the work. I found that everyone was accommodating and put time aside to attend our bi-weekly meetings. From working on this assignment, I have taken away that planning is very crucial to any project. It is important to assign and delineate all the tasks from the start of the project so that everyone knows what they are doing and to ensure that all tasks, big and small, get done. </p>
