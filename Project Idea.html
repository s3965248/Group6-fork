				 <h2>Overview  </h2>
				 <p>Our project will be an app that allows users to swap plants, produce and seedlings. It is aimed at plant enthusiasts, a market segment that saw significant growth across the pandemic. For example, the US market for indoor plants saw a growth of 18% since 2019 with 66% of households across all demographics now owning at least one indoor plant (Civic Science 2000). Furthermore, plant ownership (being a “plant parent”, was something that 7 out of 10 millennials identified with, which makes this market segment ideal as a focus for our initial offering (Garden Pals 2022). The app will allow users to conveniently find and match with others in their local area who are also looking to swap or give away plants. The concept of this app is akin to a dating app that also features some elements of social media. </p>
       </section>

			 <section>
				 <h2>Motivation </h2>
				 <p>The reasons our team chose to focus on this app included:  </p>
				 <p>
					 <ul>
						 <li>Two team-mates had relevant personal experience: one as a collector of indoor plants, and the other as a gardener. This gave our team an insight into what functionality the end user may want. </li>
						 <li>As discussed in the ‘Overview’ section, there a marked interested in indoor plants and related products in the last couple of years. </li>
						 <li>We are confident that an initial, pared-down release of the app is within our technical capabilities (see our team’s skill set on the <a href="Industry Data.html">Industry Data page</a>) while still being acceptable to our key demographic. </li>
						</ul>
				 <p>
				 <p>We believe the app has the potential to be successful, because in addition to the general current popularity of indoor plants, the app also builds on behaviours and culture that already exists among people who garden and own indoor plants. For example, propagating succulents from cuttings is easy and most users of the app will already be doing so and giving these cuttings to their friends. This app will fit easily with this already occurring behaviour, making it easy for users to adopt the app and continue to use it. </p>

				 <h2>Description </h2>
				  <p>Users sign up to create their own profile, under which they can list the plants that they are willing to swap. Users can view members that are geographically close to them and their listings. They are also able to search for specific listings. Once a user finds a plant listing that they desire, they can send a request through to swap for one of their own plants. The member who receives the swap request can choose to decline it or accept it. If they accept the request, this will allow the users to message each other to proceed further with the trade. </p>
					<h3>Main Features of the App:</h3>
						<p><em>Features for Release 1</em></p>
						<p>Catalogue: Users would be able to access a catalogue that they can search by using a tag system to classify the specifics of each plant. These different categories would be sorted in drop down menus allowing the user to pick from types of plants and location to narrow down what the user is searching for. </p>
						<p>Profile Page: Each user would have a profile page with basic information such as names and general location this would also be where a user can have all their plants listed allowing other users to see if the user has any plants they would be interested in. </p>
						<p>Form to add plants: this form would accept information about the plant such as name, type, a short description, photos and allow the user to pick what tags they want their plant listed under in the catalogue to allow users to search for their plant. <p>
						<p>Email: Users will be able to email the owner of a plant they’re interested in to set up a meet or find out more information. To protect privacy no users will be able to access the email address of other users this will all be hidden. </p>

						<p><em>Features for release 2</em></p>
						<p>Easy log-in: Easy log-in would allow users to use other social accounts such as Facebook, Google etc. to set-up their new account making it quicker and easier for new users to sign up and input all their information. </p>
						<p>Search: Searching would allow users to search though the catalogue with more specific wording than just the normal tags they’re able to access allowing for a more refined search showing exactly what the user is looking for. </p>
						<p>Maps: this would allow the user to see visually on a map the general location of where a user is located and allow them to search through different plants based on their location. </p>
						<p>Messaging: Allowing users to chat with each other when they’re wanting to swap a plant to organise the specifics. <p>
						<p>Push-notification: This would allow the app to send the user helpful notifications such as plants they would be interested in and messages from other users. </p>
						<p>Forums: This would be a place where users would post questions about plants and are able to answer other people’s queries. Forums could be separated into different categories allowing users to find exactly what they’re looking for. By having forums, it would allow more users to connect and build a sense of community allowing people with the same interests to interact and discuss. </p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>
					 <p>Initially, the app concept will be developed as a wireframe using Sketch. A wireframe allows all teammates to develop a clear shared understanding of the project’s features and generates a visual that can be used to solicit investment (Sketch B.V. 2022). Furthermore, a basic understanding of Git and GitHub would be necessary to develop this product effectively as a team. </p>
					 <p>As the initial release of this app is relatively simple, it could be developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. React Native (an open-source framework) could be used to turn a webpage built with these tools into an app that would run on any platform, including Android and iOS (Facebook Open Source 2022). </p>
					 <p>Adobe Creative Cloud can be used to create the design elements of the app such as the logo, illustrations, and background images. </p>
					 <p>To make this app available to users would require a server to host the app content, such as Azure or Google Cloud. It would also need to be available on commonly used app stores for both Android and iOS. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Skills Required </h2>
					<p>Before using React the following skills are required:</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>HTML </li>
							<li>CSS </li>
							<li>Basic JavaScript </li>
							<li>JSX (a JavaScript syntax extension) </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>HTML, CSS and beginner JavaScript courses are abundant. Free, online courses that cover the first two of these elements include Free Code Camp’s <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a>, and Scrimba’s <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss" target="_blank">HTML and CSS Crash Course</a>. React, including JSX, has a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html" target="_blank">detailed document library</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" target="_blank"> tutorial </a>.  </p>
					<p>A GitHub account would be required; and ideally a text and source-code editor (such as Atom or Notepad++) and the CLI or a CLI emulator like Git Bash. </p>
					<p>Furthermore, to create an attractive interface with original design elements, design skills and the ability to use a suite such as Adobe Creative Cloud would be favourable.  </p>
					<p>No particular hardware is required to develop this project, and only minimal software purchases, making it a good entry-level project. However, a significant time investment is required to build the skills outlined above for someone new to programming. It would be best accomplished by a team with a diverse skillset. </p>

					<h2>Outcome </h2>
					<p>This app would initially attract a dedicated group of largely millennial and Gen Z users who view plant ownership as a central part of their identity (Civic Science 2000). It will also attract those interested in the gifting economy, which has also seen a large increase in users throughout the pandemic on platforms such as When people participate in gifting economies there is a demonstrable social benefit beyond the goods exchanged, including sustainability and improved community participation (Thygesen 2019). These benefits are synergistic with the benefits of having indoor plants, which range from the physical (improvement of indoor air quality) to the psychological (improved reports of positive emotions and wellbeing) (Han & Ruan 2019; Yeo 2020). The app’s combined credentials in sustainability and wellness would make it extremely attractive to investors (Sangiorgi & Schopohl 2021), which along with promotion from the initial dedicated user-base would allow for the release of a second version with much greater functionality. </p>
