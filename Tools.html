				 <h2>GitHub Information: </h2>
				 <p>To make our group website we used the applications
					 Atom and GitHub Desktop to create, edit, and add all the
					 aspects of our project to the GitHub repository created by team
					 member Shannon with all other team members as collaborators.
					 Each team member added in their own research tasks and other parts
					 were split amongst the members of our group.<br><br>
					<a href="https://github.com/SMBBurtRush/Group6.git">GitHub Repository</a></p>

					<h3>Graph of overall contributions to repository: </h3>
					<p><img src="contributions all.png" alt="Graph of Team Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter">
						This graph reflects very well our team's overall effort from the
						very beginning to the very end of our time working on the assignment.
						It shows that at the beginning there was not as much going into the
						repository as we were still working on the content. However, you can
						still see that the team was working on the basic framework for the
						website right from the beginning; particularly Shannon and Matthew
						(Quinn). The graph also reflects our unfortunate struggle to get
						everything uploaded and perfected towards the end of the timeline.</p>



						<table class="center">
	 					 <tr>
	 						 <td style="vertical-align: top"><strong><p>Anna:
							 <img src="contributions Anna.png" alt="Graph of Anna's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter"></strong>
							 Anna’s graph clearly reflects her struggles to get her work
							 finalised and uploaded onto the website until the very end of the
							 timeline. Unfortunately, Anna was unable to get her work finished
							 until very late in the assignment period despite being offered
							 help on multiple occasions. </p></td>

	 						 <td style="vertical-align: top"><strong><p>Jordan:
							 <img src="contributions Jordan.png" alt="Graph of Jordan's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter"></strong>
								 Jordan’s graph reflects that most of his work was contributions
								 to the report document rather than the GitHub repository. His
								 contribution to the website was the page for the research task
								 that he took on.</p></td>
	 					 </tr>

	 					 <tr>
	 						 <td style="vertical-align: top"><strong><p>Shannon:
								 <img src="contributions Shannon.png" alt="Graph of Shannon's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter"></strong>
								 Unfortunately, Shannon’s graph is somewhat deceiving as it seems
								 to portray them only putting in work at the very beginning of
								 the timeline and then not putting in half that same effort
								 towards the middle and end. Shannon put consistent work into
								 the assignment from the very beginning to the very end, with
								 focus on both the report document as well as the GitHub
								 repository. At the beginning they built most of the initial
								 framework for the website and added and edited work on the
								 website and the report document throughout the middle and end
								 of the timeline.
							 </p></td>

	 						 <td style="vertical-align: top"><strong><p>Matthew:
								 <img src="contributions Matthew.png" alt="Graph of Matthew's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter"></strong>
								 Matthew’s graph reflects very clearly that their contributions
								 started from the very beginning of the timeline, specifically
								 in building the initial framework for the website. In the
								 middle of the timeline, you can see that Matthew got their work
								 uploaded and formatted onto the website with some light edits
								 and fixes towards the end of the timeline.
	 						 </p></td>
	 					 </tr>



						 <tr>
	 	 						 <td colspan = 2><strong><p>Marah: </strong><br><img src="contributions Marah2.png" alt="Graph of Marah's Contributions" height = 200 class="marah">
	 								 <img src="contributions Marah.png" alt="Graph of Marah's Contributions" height = 200 class="marah">
	 	 						 <br>Marah made the mistake of using an old account to add her commits
	 							 at the beginning of the assignment before realising her mistake
	 							 and switching back to the correct account, which is why her work
	 							 was split into two separate graphs. The combination of the two
	 							 graphs reflects very well on the consistency of work Marah put
	 							 into the assignment throughout the timeline. She was lacking in
	 							 contributions on the repository at the beginning of the timeline
	 							 since the framework was created by Shannon and Matthew at the
	 							 beginning of the assignment period.

						<h2>Microsoft Teams Information: </h2>
						<p>Microsoft Teams was used as our teams' base for communication.
							Microsoft Teams was utilised very well by our team. We had biweekly
							meetings to split up work among team members, checking in on
							progress and discussing what needs to be done. We also used posts
							in the group feed to update each other on progress, ask for and
							offer help when needed, asking for the input of other team members
							on aspects of the website, and many more things.
