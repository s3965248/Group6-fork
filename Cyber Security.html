       <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
       <section>
				 <h2>What is it?</h2>
				 <p>Cyber security is the defence against cyber threats for systems
					 connected to the internet, including their hardware, software, and
					 data. Individuals and businesses both utilise this to prevent illegal
					  access to data centres and other digital systems. These cyber
						attacks typically try to gain access to, alter, or delete sensitive
						data; demand money from users; or obstruct regular corporate
						operations.
					</p>
					<h3>What is new in cyber security?</h3>
					<h4>Growing threat of ransomware</h4>
					<p>Ransomware has become more popular over the past 20 years because
						it can more easily bring financial rewards to hackers. Ransomware
						is currently thought to come in 124 different families, and hackers
						are already quite skilled at concealing dangerous code. The most
						recent and advanced malware is not always necessary for hackers to
						succeed; it is not too difficult for a hacker to do. Nearly a
						quarter of the incident-response engagements for IBM Security’s
						X-Force threat intelligence group last year involved ransomware.
					</p>
					<h4>The internet of vulnerable things (The Internet of Things evolving)
					</h4>
					<p>This year, the number of interconnected devices is expected to
						reach 18 billion. As a result, there are a lot more potential
						access points for cyber criminals trying to break into secure
						digital systems. The Internet of Things (IoT) has long been
						recognised as posing a specific threat. Past attacks have included
						hackers using connected home appliances like fridges and kettles to
						gain access to networks, then using those connections to gain access
						 to computers or phones where valuable data may be stored.
					 </p>
					 <h4>Remote working cyber security risks</h4>
					 <p>One of the most talked about trends in cyber security is working
						 from home, which presents new cyber security threats. Compared to
						 centralised offices, which typically have more secure routers,
						 firewalls, and access control systems managed by IT security teams,
						  home offices are much less safe. Traditional security vetting may
							not have been as thorough as usual in the race to keep things
							operating. As a result, cybercriminals may have adapted their
							strategies to their benefit. In addition to having mobile apps
							for instant messaging services like Microsoft Teams and Zoom,
							many employees use their own devices for two-factor
							authentication. The possibility that private information
							could end up in the wrong hands grows because of these fuzzier
							distinctions between personal and professional life. As a result,
							a crucial trend in cyber security is for businesses to concentrate
							 on the security issues associated with remote workforces.
						 </p>
						 <h3>What can be done now? </h3>
						 <h4>AI-powered cyber security </h4>
						 <p>Human beings are unable to handle the volume of cyber security
							 threats on their own. As a result, businesses are increasingly
							 using machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve
							 their security infrastructure. There are also financial benefits
							 to doing this; in 2020, firms who experienced a data breach but
							 had fully implemented AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology
							 saved an average of $3.58 million.
								 <br><br>
							Natural language processing, face recognition, and autonomous
							security systems have all benefited greatly from AI. AI also
							allows for far faster analysis of vast amounts of risk data.
							Both large businesses dealing with large volumes of data and
							small or mid-sized businesses with under-resourced security
							teams can benefit from this.
							 </p>
							 <h4>Multi-factor authentication improving </h4>
							 <p>Multi-factor authentication is regarded as the gold standard
								 of authentication. However, malicious actors are developing
								 new strategies to get around it, particularly when
								 authentication is done by SMS or phone calls. Because of this,
								 Microsoft suggested that customers discontinue using
								 phone-based MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) in 2020 and
								 switch to app-based authenticators and security keys. Although
								 SMS offers some built-in security, the messages delivered,
								 including those used for authentication, are not encrypted.
								 Because of this, people are now capable of automating
								 man-in-the-middle attacks to collect plain-text one-time
								 passcodes. This creates vulnerability for actions like online
								 banking, where SMS is frequently used for authentication.
							 </p>
							 <h3>What is likely to be able to be done soon
								 (say in the next 3 years)?
							 </h3>
							 <p>By 2025, 80% of enterprises will adopt a strategy to unify
								 web, cloud services and private application access from a
								 single vendor’s SSE platform. Companies are providing an
								 integrated security service edge (SSE) solution to expedite
								 and privatise online access to their customers together with
								 Security as a Service (SaaS) application security as hybrid
								 and remote work continue to gain popularity and regularity.
								 The best efficiency and security effectiveness in this area
								 can be achieved by switching to a single-vendor system.
								 <br><br>
								 By 2025, threat actors will have weaponised operational
								 technology environments successfully to cause human casualties.
								 Unfortunately, as IoT spreads throughout big cities, these
								 gadgets become more vulnerable to online assaults. The
								 potential for real-world threats to people and the environment
								 are increased by the capacity of hackers to access equipment
								 like streetlights, creating chances for criminals to exploit
								 these linked devices.
								 <br><br>
								 By 2025, 70% of CEOs will mandate a culture of organisational
								 resilience to survive coinciding threats from cybercrime,
								 sever weather events, civil unrest, and political
								 instabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed numerous
								 companies’ shortcomings in the case of a significant
								 disruption. Within the next three years, organisations are
								 expected to have increased planning and support in place
								 because of the pandemic, making organisational resilience
								 a primary priority going forwards.
							 </p>
							 <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
							 <h3>What is the potential impact of this development? </h3>
							 <p>Cyber security has always been an uphill battle, but change is
								  happening faster now. Businesses continue to make investments
									in technology to run their operations. To support remote work,
									improve the customer experience, and generate revenue, they
									are currently adding more technologies to their IT networks,
									which could lead to new vulnerabilities.
									<br><br>
									The traditional threat of a lone hacker is no longer present.
									Cyber hacking is a multibillion-dollar industry nowadays,
									they have institutional structures and R&D budgets. Attackers
									employ innovative tools like automation, machine learning, and
									artificial intelligence. They will be able to shorten the
									end-to-end attack life cycle, from reconnaissance to
									exploitation, from weeks to days or hours during the next few
									years.
									<br><br>
									Cyber risk management has not kept pace with the proliferation
									of digital analytics transformations, and many companies are
									not sure how to identify and manage digital risks.
							 </p>
							 <h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
							 <p>New threats surface every hour of every day in the
								 technological world of today. By connecting to the internet,
								 the likelihood that a hacker may target your company increases.
								 Cybercrime danger and cybercrime are major global concerns for
								 businesses and governments. If organisations do not have a
								 suitable cyber security plan, there are significant financial
								 and reputational consequences.
							 </p>
							 <h3>Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs
								 or technologies?
							 </h3>
							 <p>The increase in cybercrime risk that comes with the
								 development of technology will result in an increase in jobs
								 for cyber security professionals. Globally, cybercrime is
								 increasing, a corresponding rise in demand for cyber security
								 professionals has created a skill shortage, pushing up
								 salaries. Future career growth in cyber security is anticipated
								 to increase tremendously.
							 </p>
							 <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
							 <p>Cyber security affects everyone in their daily lives in this
								 technology dependent time. Most people use the internet every
								 single day of their lives nowadays. Without cyber security
								 anyone could get a hold of our privileged information anytime
								 they wanted to. The risk of being targeted by cyber criminals
								 is much lower for individuals than it is for businesses,
								 governments, and corporations but, it is still important for
								 the internet to be safe for everyone. Electrical blackouts,
								 equipment failure, and disclosure of sensitive national
								 security information can all be brought on by cyberattacks.
								 They may lead to the theft of priceless and confidential
								 information, including medical records. They may paralyse
								 systems or interfere with phone and computer networks,
								 rendering data inaccessible. Cyber security can affect anyone
								 whether it be directly right from the start or after some time.
								 It is not an exaggeration to say that cyber threats may affect
								 the functioning of life as we know it.
							 	 <br><br>
							 	 There are many types of cyber attacks that can affect both
								 individuals and bigger companies. Phishing is a cyber attack
								 carried out via email in which a recipient is duped into
								 opening a link and downloading malicious software or divulging
								 personal information. Ransomware is a cyber attack that
								 encrypts data on the target machine and holds the user hostage
								 until they pay a ransom to unlock the data.
							 	 <br><br>
							 	 Cyber security development affects you, your friends, and your
								 family in all these ways. Any of these things could happen to
								 you, your friends, or your family or even businesses or
								 governments that will eventually have an effect on you
								 indirectly.
