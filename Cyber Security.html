								<h2>What is it?</h2>
								<p>Cyber security is the defence against cyber threats for systems
									connected to the internet, including their hardware, software, and
									data. Individuals and businesses both utilise this to prevent illegal
									access to data centres and other digital systems. These cyber
									attacks typically try to gain access to, alter, or delete sensitive
									data; demand money from users; or obstruct regular corporate operations.
								</p>

								<h3>What is new in cyber security?</h3>
								<h4>Growing threat of ransomware</h4>
								<p>Ransomware has become more popular over the past 20 years because
									it can more easily bring financial rewards to hackers. Ransomware
									is currently thought to come in 124 different families, and hackers
									are already quite skilled at concealing dangerous code. The most
									recent and advanced malware is not always necessary for hackers to
									succeed; it is not too difficult for a hacker to do. Nearly a
									quarter of the incident-response engagements for IBM Security’s
									X-Force threat intelligence group last year involved ransomware.
								</p>

								<h4>The internet of vulnerable things (The Internet of Things evolving)</h4>
								<p>This year, the number of interconnected devices is expected to
									reach 18 billion. As a result, there are a lot more potential
									access points for cyber criminals trying to break into secure
									digital systems. The Internet of Things (IoT) has long been
									recognised as posing a specific threat. Past attacks have included
									hackers using connected home appliances like fridges and kettles to
									gain access to networks, then using those connections to gain access
						 			to computers or phones where valuable data may be stored.
								</p>

					 			<h4>Remote working cyber security risks</h4>
					 			<p>One of the most talked about trends in cyber security is working
									from home, which presents new cyber security threats. Compared to
						 			centralised offices, which typically have more secure routers,
						 			firewalls, and access control systems managed by IT security teams,
						  		home offices are much less safe. Traditional security vetting may
									not have been as thorough as usual in the race to keep things
									operating. As a result, cybercriminals may have adapted their
									strategies to their benefit. In addition to having mobile apps
									for instant messaging services like Microsoft Teams and Zoom,
									many employees use their own devices for two-factor
									authentication. The possibility that private information
									could end up in the wrong hands grows because of these fuzzier
									distinctions between personal and professional life. As a result,
									a crucial trend in cyber security is for businesses to concentrate
							 		on the security issues associated with remote workforces.
								</p>

								<h3>What can be done now? </h3>
						 		<h4>AI-powered cyber security </h4>
						 		<p>Human beings are unable to handle the volume of cyber security
									threats on their own. As a result, businesses are increasingly
							 		using machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve
							 		their security infrastructure. There are also financial benefits
							 		to doing this; in 2020, firms who experienced a data breach but
							 		had fully implemented AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology
							 		saved an average of $3.58 million.
								 	<br><br>
								 	Natural language processing, face recognition, and autonomous
									security systems have all benefited greatly from AI. AI also
									allows for far faster analysis of vast amounts of risk data.
									Both large businesses dealing with large volumes of data and
									small or mid-sized businesses with under-resourced security
									teams can benefit from this.
								</p>

								<h4>Multi-factor authentication improving </h4>
								<p>Multi-factor authentication is regarded as the gold standard
									of authentication(“Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is
								 	Regarded as the Gold ... - IT Voice”). However, malicious actors
								 	are developing
								 	new strategies to get around it, particularly when
								 	authentication is done by SMS or phone calls. Because of this,
								 	Microsoft suggested that customers discontinue using
								 	phone-based MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) in 2020 and
								 	switch to app-based authenticators and security keys. Although
								 	SMS offers some built-in security, the messages delivered,
								 	including those used for authentication, are not encrypted.
								 	Because of this, people are now capable of automating
								 	man-in-the-middle attacks to collect plain-text one-time
								 	passcodes. This creates vulnerability for actions like online
								 	banking, where SMS is frequently used for authentication.
								</p>
								<h3>What is likely to be able to be done soon
									(say in the next 3 years)?</h3>
									<p>By 2025, 80% of enterprises will adopt a strategy to unify
										web, cloud services and private application access from a
								 		single vendor’s SSE platform(“Gartner: 8 Ways Cybersecurity
								 		Will Change Companies”) . Companies are providing an
								 		integrated security service edge (SSE) solution to expedite
								 		and privatise online access to their customers together with
								 		Security as a Service (SaaS) application security as hybrid
								 		and remote work continue to gain popularity and regularity.
								 		The best efficiency and security effectiveness in this area
								 		can be achieved by switching to a single-vendor system.
								 		<br><br>
								 		By 2025, threat actors will have weaponised operational
								 		technology environments successfully to cause human casualties.
								 		Unfortunately, as IoT spreads throughout big cities, these
								 		gadgets become more vulnerable to online assaults. The
								 		potential for real-world threats to people and the environment
								 		are increased by the capacity of hackers to access equipment
								 		like streetlights, creating chances for criminals to exploit
								 		these linked devices.
								 		<br><br>
								 		By 2025, 70% of CEOs will mandate a culture of organisational
								 		resilience to survive coinciding threats from cybercrime,
								 		sever weather events, civil unrest, and political
								 		instabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed numerous
								 		companies’ shortcomings in the case of a significant
								 		disruption. Within the next three years, organisations are
								 		expected to have increased planning and support in place
								 		because of the pandemic, making organisational resilience
								 		a primary priority going forwards.
									</p>

									<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
									<h3>What is the potential impact of this development? </h3>
							 		<p>Cyber security has always been an uphill battle, but change is
										happening faster now. Businesses continue to make investments
										in technology to run their operations. To support remote work,
										improve the customer experience, and generate revenue, they
										are currently adding more technologies to their IT networks,
										which could lead to new vulnerabilities.
										<br><br>
										The traditional threat of a lone hacker is no longer present.
										Cyber hacking is a multibillion-dollar industry nowadays,
										they have institutional structures and R&D budgets. Attackers
										employ innovative tools like automation, machine learning, and
										artificial intelligence. They will be able to shorten the
										end-to-end attack life cycle, from reconnaissance to
										exploitation, from weeks to days or hours during the next few
										years.
										<br><br>
										Cyber risk management has not kept pace with the proliferation
										of digital analytics transformations, and many companies are
										not sure how to identify and manage digital risks.
									</p>

									<h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
									<p>New threats surface every hour of every day in the
										technological world of today. By connecting to the internet,
								 		the likelihood that a hacker may target your company increases.
								 		Cybercrime danger and cybercrime are major global concerns for
								 		businesses and governments. If organisations do not have a
								 		suitable cyber security plan, there are significant financial
								 		and reputational consequences.
									</p>

									<h3>Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs
										or technologies?</h3>
										<p>The increase in cybercrime risk that comes with the
											development of technology will result in an increase in jobs
								 			for cyber security professionals. Globally, cybercrime is
								 			increasing, a corresponding rise in demand for cyber security
								 			professionals has created a skill shortage, pushing up
								 			salaries. Future career growth in cyber security is anticipated
								 			to increase tremendously.
										</p>

										<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
										<p>Cyber security affects everyone in their daily lives in this
											technology dependent time. Most people use the internet every
								 			single day of their lives nowadays. Without cyber security
								 			anyone could get a hold of our privileged information anytime
								 			they wanted to. The risk of being targeted by cyber criminals
								 			is much lower for individuals than it is for businesses,
								 			governments, and corporations but, it is still important for
								 			the internet to be safe for everyone. Electrical blackouts,
								 			equipment failure, and disclosure of sensitive national
								 			security information can all be brought on by cyberattacks.
								 			They may lead to the theft of priceless and confidential
								 			information, including medical records. They may paralyse
								 			systems or interfere with phone and computer networks,
								 			rendering data inaccessible. Cyber security can affect anyone
								 			whether it be directly right from the start or after some time.
								 			It is not an exaggeration to say that cyber threats may affect
								 			the functioning of life as we know it.
											<br><br>
							 	 			There are many types of cyber attacks that can affect both
								 			individuals and bigger companies. Phishing is a cyber attack
								 			carried out via email in which a recipient is duped into
								 			opening a link and downloading malicious software or divulging
								 			personal information. Ransomware is a cyber attack that
								 			encrypts data on the target machine and holds the user hostage
								 			until they pay a ransom to unlock the data.
							 	 			<br><br>
							 	 			Cyber security development affects you, your friends, and your
								 			family in all these ways. Any of these things could happen to
								 			you, your friends, or your family or even businesses or
								 			governments that will eventually have an effect on you
								 			indirectly.
