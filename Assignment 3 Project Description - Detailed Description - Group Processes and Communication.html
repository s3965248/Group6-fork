								<h3>Group Processes and Communication</h3>
								<h4>Reflection on Assignment 2</h4>
								<p>Ultimately, our group got through assignment through well even though we struggled with some aspects of working in a team, especially towards the end of the assignment period. All the members of the group contributed to the assignment and were more than happy to volunteer for work. Unfortunately, some team members were exceedingly difficult to communicate with in between meetings, not responding to posts directed at the entire for feedback or even to private messages about issues concerning them directly. Another issue we faced as a group was some of the team members struggling to keep to deadlines and handing in work much too close to the final submission deadline, which resulted in work being submitted unedited/proofread or even unfinished. Admittedly, work could have been distributed more evenly throughout the group as some members ended up making a small contribution toward the assignment.</p>
								<h4>New Processes for Assignment 3</h4>
								<p>We are determined not to face the same struggles through this assignment period as we did the last. For this assignment we have decided to focus on improving our organisation and having a more in-depth timeline with a clear accountability process for delivering on agreed-upon deadline. We created a detailed list of every task that needs to be completed and when for the assignment to be ready for submission ahead of the deadline to guarantee time for final edits and clean up for both assignment 3 and assignment 5. Each task was distributed to one or more team members, and a due date was set. We also agreed as a team that if the due date was not met by a group member, it will be assigned to a different member, and we would seek aid from the tutors if necessary. We also refined our use of Teams, because some team members found it overwhelming, by creating separate channels for meetings, the report, the deliverables, and the presentation, making the lines of communication more effective and organised for all team-mates. As a team we also agreed to be more responsive to posts directed at the group as through the last assignment only a few members of the group had been responsive, and members werenâ€™t receiving the feedback they needed.</p>
