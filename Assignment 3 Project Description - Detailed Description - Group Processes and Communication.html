								<h2>Detailed Description - Group Processes and Communication</h2>
								<p>Our group has decided to keep all communication to our team on Microsoft teams, where we will hold group meetings, which all members are expected to attend, twice a week; Wednesdays at 6:30pm and Sundays at 2:00pm. During these meetings members are expected to have their cameras and microphones on and to contribute to discussions, when necessary, any serious issues will be addressed during these live meetings. We have also created different channels for the various aspects of the assignments so, members can write posts asking for help, feedback, or anything they require on days a meeting isnâ€™t scheduled in the corresponding channel. Finally, members can send private messages to other members of the group if they feel an issue needs to be taken up away from the rest of the team; this should only be used as a final resort as the entire should be kept in the loop on most issues about the assignment.</p>
								<p>We have also agreed on processes in case members of the team become suddenly unresponsive. As a team we decided that in this case we will reassign any jobs that member was assigned as best we can and reach out to our tutors for help on what to do from there. Team members are expected to attend all meetings and notify the group if they are ever unable to attend. Group members are also expected to respond to posts directed at the team and private messages when appropriate and in a timely manner.</p>
