								<h2>GitHub:</h2>
								<p>A fork of the GitHub repository we used in Assessment 2 was
									used to create our website for Assessment 3. Separate pages
									were created to make both assessments accessible from the same
									website. Atom was used with GitHub Desktop to create, edit,
									and add all the parts of our website to the GitHub repository.
									The new design aspects and formatting were created by team member
									Marah while the rest of the team members added and organised
									the written parts of the report that they were each assigned.
									For this assessment the involvement of most members of the
									group to the repository was minimal as they were involved
									more in other parts of the assignment.
								</p>
								<p>The individual contribution graphs for this Assessment
									reflect the actual contributions of our group’s members
									incredibly poorly as most work was done using different
									tools (discussed in the ‘Tools and Technologies’ section of
									the report). Most of the team are shown to have only contributed
									toward the end of the timeline however, in the meantime, Anna
									was working on creating the wireframe, storyboard, and editing
									the presentation video, Jordan was working on creating the
									backend of the PlantR application, Matthew was working on
									creating the frontend of the PlantR application, and Shannon
									was writing the script and filming the presentation content,
									as well as everyone working on writing the content for the report.

												<strong><p>Graph of overall contributions to repository: </strong>
												<img src="Assignment 3 Group Contribution Graph.jpg" alt="Graph of Team Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter">
												<br>Although there was much more work done away from the
											 	repository for this assessment (using different tools for
											 	different parts) than the previous one, this graph still
											 	reflects our efforts, from the beginning to the end of
											 	the time spent on the assessment, quite well. It shows
											 	that we had a strong start from the beginning on July
											 	20th, then a dip while tasks were being split between
											 	group members and the content of the report was being
											 	written and edited, and then a strong finish until the
											 	deadline we set for the website to be finished on August
											 	17th. The rising contributions show the effort put in by
											 	Marah to improve the design aspects of our group’s website
											 	and the peak at the end of the timeline shows all the
											 	team members adding their parts to the website after
											 	everything had been written, proofread, and edited.</p>

											<td style="vertical-align: top">
												<strong><p>Anna:</strong>
												<img src="Assignment 3 Anna Contribution Graph.jpg" alt="Graph of Anna's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter">
												Anna’s graph shows her adding her work to the
										 		repository towards the end of the timeline with
										 		added effort in coming back and ensuring that any
										 		flaws were fixed. She also added a page for the
										 		presentation to be displayed on our group’s website.</p>

											<td style="vertical-align: top">
												<strong><p>Jordan:</strong>
												<img src="Assignment 3 Jordan Contribution Graph.jpg" alt="Graph of Jordan's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter">
												Jordan’s graph reflects that most of his work was
												contributions to backend of the application used
								 				as our deliverable rather than the GitHub repository.
									 			His contribution to the website was simply adding the
									 			parts that he wrote which includes the ‘scopes and
									 			limits’ and ‘group processes’ sections.</p>

											<td style="vertical-align: top">
												<strong><p>Shannon:</strong>
												<img src="Assignment 3 Shannon Contribution Graph.jpg" alt="Graph of Shannon's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter">
												Unfortunately, Shannon’s graph is also deceiving
								 				as it only portrays them adding their content at
								 				the end of the timeline. But Shannon did a lot of
								 				the background work, on top of filming the presentation,
								 				for this assessment, they proofread and edited a
												lot of the content for the report, they wrote the
							 					script for the presentation and facilitated
							 					communication between group members that were
							 					having issues.</p>
											</td>

											<td style="vertical-align: top">
												<strong><p>Matthew:</strong>
												<img src="Assignment 3 Quinn Contribution Graph.jpg" alt="Graph of Matthew's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter">
												Matthew’s graph does not reflect their efforts toward
							 					this assessment at all. According to the graph, you would
							 					think they made no contributions. However, Matthew was
							 					putting in constant effort to creating the frontend of
							 					the application and even the backend when Jordan was suddenly ill.</p>

										<tr>
											<td colspan = 2>
												<strong><p>Marah: </strong>
													<img src="Assignment 3 Marah Contribution Graph.jpg" alt="Graph of Marah's Contributions" height = 200 class="aligncenter">
													Marah was the main contributor to the GitHub
												 	repository as she was assigned the task of enhancing
												 	the design and look of the group’s website. From the
												 	beginning of the timeline to the end, she was experimenting
												 	with different effects and design ideas that could be
												 	added to make the website look a little more professional
												 	than it did for the previous assessment. The graph
												 	reflects the added effort she put in from the middle of
												 	the timeline to the end, when she finished the multiple
												 	written sections assigned to her and focused more on
												 	improving the website.</p>

										<h2>Microsoft Teams:</h2>
										<p>Again, Microsoft Teams was used as our team’s base for
										 communication. However, this time we decided to split up
										 the different areas of work into separate channels for
										 added organisation and clarity. We created 4 new channels;
										 ‘A3 Meetings, Scheduling’ is the channel where meetings
										 were held and any concerns regarding scheduling were discussed,
										 ‘A3 Project (App Development) is where the deliverables were
										 discussed including the wireframe and testing forms, ‘A3
										 Written Report and Website’ was used for discussing website
										 developments and the written sections that needed to be included
										 in the report document, and lastly ‘A5 Presentation’ is where
										 all aspects of the presentation for Assessment 5 were discussed.
										 Biweekly meetings were also held to assign work and to check
										 in on progress as well as to brainstorm ideas for website
										 design, deliverables, and the presentation.</p>
