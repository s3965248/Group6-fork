								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<h3>Topic</h3>
								<p>Plantr is an app that facilitates the trade of plants, produce and seedlings. Users sign up and create a profile. They can then list the plants that they want to swap using a form. The user would then be able to browse through the listings, initially organised by plant-type and location tags, to find the plants that they are looking for. In the first release of the app users would then be able to email one another (with email addresses not visible to the user, to protect privacy), and request their listed plants.</p>
								<p>This app primarily targets the indoor plant hobbyists that is an increasingly growing demographic. However, people of all ages and backgrounds that have an interest in gardening would find use in the app. The app therefore has the potential to attract a large and diverse market. The release of this app hopes to nurture and grow a vibrant local plant community. The app aims to promote plant growing as a hobby, as it is shown to have therapeutics benefits to help de-stress and boost one’s mood, as well improve air quality in the environment (Haskins, 2017). Plantr also aims to build strong community relationships by fostering the gift economy. When people participate in gifting economies there is a demonstrable social benefit beyond the goods exchanged, including sustainability and improved community participation (Thygesen 2019).</p>

								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>Plantr was pursued by the team as a few members have an interest in indoor plants and gardening, and therefore would understand the needs of the key demographic that this app is catered towards for. The app is intended the plant growing as a hobby. As this is shown to have health benefits and promotes sustainability.</p>
								<p>The app also aims to capitalize on the increasing interest in houseplants in the past few years that has been facilitated through social media with the emergence of "Plantfluencers". In the past few years, platforms such as Instagram and TikTok have been used to generate large interest in indoor plants as users share images of their extensive collections of plants and growing tips. This has led to an influx of new buyers that have put a strain on the supply causing prices for indoor plants to have jumped by 19% in the U.S in 2021 ((Litterest, 2021).</p>

								<h3>Landscape</h3>
								<p>While most consumers buy their plants at local nurseries, the pandemic has led to an increase of users ordering plants from online nurseries. Users looking to find reduced prices compared to what is offered by large retailers would seek second-hand ecommerce platforms, with the biggest being Facebook Marketplace and Gumtree. Both Facebook Marketplace and Gumtree allow small vendors to list plants that they are looking to sell. However, due to the overwhelmingly enormous number of posts on both Facebook and Gumtree, users who are looking to find a specific plant would find it difficult to locate it. On the other hand, as Plantr is a platform that is purely dedicated to plants, the catalogue function would have the relevant categories in order assist users in easily finding the plants they are after.</p>
