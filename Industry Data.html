					 <p>The highest demand was for Software Engineers, potentially because of the diverse range of tasks that can be undertaken in that role. Web Developers had a similar level of demand to most types of Software Developers (including Full Stack). There was no data about Gameplay Developers, but a recent industry survey suggests that there are only 433 total roles in the industry in Australia, making it a niche profession.</p>

					<p>Future demand was strong across all general job titles (software engineer, web developer and software developer). There was no specific data for full-stack software developers or gameplay developers, so these have been included under the umbrella term of ‘software developer’. However, because gameplay development is a relatively niche industry, demand may in fact be relatively static in Australia.</p>

					<p>The three industry areas of interest all had strong future growth and a medium-sized share of the labour market. Annual average salary for software engineers and developer programmers was above the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/earnings-and-working-conditions/average-weekly-earnings-australia/nov-2021" target="_blank">national average for full time workers of $90,900</a>. The average salary for web developers was slightly below this. All three professions still showed a significant under-representation of women (from the high of 17% in web development to only 12% in software engineering).</p>

						 <td>Anna</td>
						 <td>Web developer</td>
						 <td>After reviewing the data, I can see that there are less roles available for web developers compared to other tech professional. It appears that the salary is comparatively low and there are less full-time roles available as well. This has made be reconsider the job as it seems not as stable as I imagined. However, I still think it may be a good steppingstone for a career in technology.</td>
					 </tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Shannon</td>
						<td>Web developer</td>
						<td>I am concerned that the labour market data showed only 17% of web developers are female (I am non-binary and I find treatment of women in a field is a good indicator of how LGBTQIA+ people will be treated). However, this is still a field I am very interested and keen to pursue.</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Matthew (Quinn)</td>
						<td>Gameplay developer</td>
						<td>I am happy that the demand for gameplay developers is strong, but the equality is poor, and the salary is less than $100,000. Critical thinking is not a problem with me and the reading comprehension too. The only part I may have trouble with is the active listening – I can be stubborn with how I do things sometimes and I don’t really ask many questions. I mostly figure it out on my own. In the end it just boils down to which company I work for, though I may eventually want to leave gameplay development and go into web development.</td>
					</tr>

						<td>Jess</td>

					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Marah</td>
						<td>Software engineer</td>
						<td>I am very satisfied with the information shown here. It appears that the annual salary as well as the demand for Software Engineers is remarkably high. My only concern would be that the female share is only 12%, which not only is the lowest out of all the researched occupations but also incredibly low in general. As for the key skills, I believe that I am very capable of succeeding in the general skills and will soon have the IT skills as well. The data has only made me look more favourably toward the occupation of Software Engineer.</td>
