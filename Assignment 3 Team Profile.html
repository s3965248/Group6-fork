								<h2>Team Name: Plants R Us</h2>
								<p>This is a whimsical name based on our project idea that would not reflect poorly on us if a potential employer were to see it. </p>

				           <td>Hi, my name is Anna, and I am 20 years old. Since graduating high school I have been working in a customer facing role at a bank. I enjoy cooking in my spare time and trying foods from other cuisines. I am also an aquarium hobbyist and love to keep fish. As a side hustle, I make a little bit of pocket change by selling guppies and cherry shrimp. Two TV shows that I am currently watching are ‘The Boys’ and ‘Better Call Saul’. I became interested in IT as a potential career path as it is such a broad field and there are many areas that I could foray into. I do not have that much practical knowledge in IT. However, my father works in the IT sector, and I can see that he really enjoys his job. He encouraged me to try out some IT courses to see if it would suit me as well. I chose RMIT as this course was flexible enough to allow me to work during the weekdays. I am also looking at possibly enrolling in the Bachelor of IT once I finish the foundation subjects. Through this course I hope to gain a better understanding of what IT involves and the potential pathways into a career. I also hope to pick up some practical skills such as coding along the way. </td>

				           <td>I was born in Australia with both English and Scandinavian heritage. Like most Australians, I’m unfortunately monolingual, although my daughter and I are currently learning some Mandarin. I can also read enough Italian to cook Italian-language recipes (I’m highly motivated by pasta!). My previous degrees include a Bachelor of Arts with a major in Archaeology and Classics; a Master of Teaching; and a Bachelor of Food Science and Nutrition. It will perhaps not surprise you to hear that I work as an administration officer and put most of my energy into my hobbies. I live in a flat overlooking a duck pond with my daughter and a particularly angry Chihuahua. </td>

				              <td>My name is Marah, I’m 24 years old and I have three siblings, two sisters and a brother. I am a dual citizen; Australian and Jordanian and I moved to Melbourne in February of 2022. I currently live here with my brother who is a year younger than me.

				               Before moving to Melbourne, I was living in Amman, Jordan in the Middle East and I speak both English and Arabic fluently. I was born in Doha Qatar and have also lived in Sydney previously. Something I think is interesting is that each one of my siblings and I was born in one of the places we’ve lived throughout our childhood. My older sister was born in the city of Amman in Jordan, I was born in the city of Doha in Qatar, my brother was born in Melbourne and my little sister was born in Sydney.

				               I’ve been studying for a very long time, but the highest certificate I have achieved so far is a High School Diploma. I graduated High School in Jordan in 2016 and studied a Computer Engineering major for four years on and off at the German Jordanian University in Jordan before I had to drop out due to some family circumstances. I am now trying to get back on track to getting a degree in IT by taking some units through Open Universities Australia in hopes of the leading to a degree in Information Technology from RMIT. </td>

My IT experience has been personal projects such as: using a raspberry pi (1 and 3) and loading emulators on the pi (retro pi, retroarch and dosbox). Primarily SNES emulator and play SNES ROMS (most of the SNES games are in public domain so there is no risk of piracy). </td>

								<h2>Group Processes:</h2>
									<h3>Reflection on Assignment 2</h3>
										<p>Ultimately, our group got through assignment through well even though we struggled with some aspects of working in a team, especially towards the end of the assignment period. All the members of the group contributed to the assignment and were more than happy to volunteer for work. Unfortunately, some team members were exceedingly difficult to communicate with in between meetings, not responding to posts directed at the entire for feedback or even to private messages about issues concerning them directly. Another issue we faced as a group was some of the team members struggling to keep to deadlines and handing in work much too close to the final submission deadline, which resulted in work being submitted unedited/proofread or even unfinished. Admittedly, work could have been distributed more evenly throughout the group as some members ended up making a small contribution toward the assignment.</p>
									<h3>New Processes for Assignment 3</h3>
										<p>We are determined not to face the same struggles through this assignment period as we did the last. For this assignment we have decided to focus on improving our organisation and having a more in-depth timeline with a clear accountability process for delivering on agreed-upon deadline. We created a detailed list of every task that needs to be completed and when for the assignment to be ready for submission ahead of the deadline to guarantee time for final edits and clean up for both assignment 3 and assignment 5. Each task was distributed to one or more team members, and a due date was set. We also agreed as a team that if the due date was not met by a group member, it will be assigned to a different member, and we would seek aid from the tutors if necessary. We also refined our use of Teams, because some team members found it overwhelming, by creating separate channels for meetings, the report, the deliverables, and the presentation, making the lines of communication more effective and organised for all team-mates. As a team we also agreed to be more responsive to posts directed at the group as through the last assignment only a few members of the group had been responsive, and members weren’t receiving the feedback they needed.</p>
