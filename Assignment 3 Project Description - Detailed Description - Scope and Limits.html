								<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
								<p>Our major deliverable for this project is creating a login, seeing a profile page, adding a plant using a web-based form and being able to view other plants added by other users. </p>
								<h4>Login Page</h4>
								<p>Our ultimate goal is to create a quick login feature which allows the user to login using Google, or Facebook etc. However, with the time restraints and our current coding abilities we have decided to create basic sign-in and sign-up pages using an email and password which will allow them to enter their own personal information.</p>
								<h4>Profile Page</h4>
								<p>What we would like to implement is a rich profile page that allows the user to add information about themselves and the plants they list and allows users to view and edit their own listings for other users to see. What we believe is achievable is a basic profile page that allows the user to add and change information about themselves.</p>
								<h4>Viewing other plants</h4>
								<p>Ultimately, we would like to have a page where users can view plants and search for plants using a search bar with a filter feature that uses tags to narrow down the search. What we believe we will be able to achieve is to display a list of plants that have been added by users into our CSV database.</p>
								<h4>What is out of scope?</h4>
								<p>A major part of our project that we believe is out of our scope is being able to use React Native to make this a native app for IOS and Android. This is a goal in the long run of this project but unfortunately due to the time constraints we do not believe we will be able to achieve this.</p>
