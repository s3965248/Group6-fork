								<h2>Detailed Description - Roles</h2>
								<h3>UI/UX Designer – Anna</h3>
								<h4>What does a UX (User eXperience) designer do?</h4>
								<p>A UX designer handles the overall structure of the product: how the user will move from point A to point B within the app. UX designers are all about the user experience. They design to solve specific user problems, always keeping the user front and centre.</p>
								<h4>What does a UI (User Interface) designer do?</h4>
								<p>A UI designer doesn’t enter the process until the blueprint has been laid out by the UX designer. They are responsible for the look of the product: colour, visuals, and interactive elements. The UI designer focuses on the look and feel of the product interface.</p>
								<h4>How is Anna the UI/UX designer for our project?</h4>
								<p>Anna’s key role in this assignment was creating the app wireframe. To do this she had research and analyse existing designs to understand user needs and product goals. She also had to investigate finding the right colours and visuals to go with the project idea. Anna chose the Adobe XD program to create the wireframe, about which she did extensive research beforehand. The wireframe will communicate the flow of our project as well as the look and feel we aim to achieve. It will also be used in early user testing.<p>

								<h3>Frontend developer – Matthew </h3>
								<h4>What does a front-end developer do?</h4>
								<p>A front-end developer’s focus is on a product’s user-facing aspects. A front-end developer has one general responsibility: to ensure that website visitors can easily interact with the page. They do this through the combination of design, technology, and programming to code a website’s appearance, as well as taking care of debugging. Whenever you visit a website, anything that you see, click on or otherwise interact with is the work of a front-end developer. (“What Does a Front-End Web Developer Do? - Berkeley Boot Camps”)</p>
								<h4>How is Matthew the front-end developer for our project?</h4>
								<p>Matthew is responsible for the look and feel of the project. They will use CSS, HTML, JavaScript programming as well as using frameworks (Bootstrap) to optimise the user experience and implement design to the project.</p>

								<h3>Back-end developer – Jordan</h3>
								<h4>What does a back-end developer do?</h4>
								<p>A back-end developer’s focus is building and maintaining the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites and apps. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interfaces (APIs), architecture and servers. (“What Does a Back-End Developer Do? | Coursera”) They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases to store, understand, and delete data.</p>
								<h4>How is Jordan the back-end developer for our project?</h4>
								<p>Jordan is responsible for the creation of the database to hold the information that will be inputted by users and displayed in the listings page of our project. He hopes to use Java to create and incorporate this into the rest of the project.</p>

								<h4>What does a quality assurance specialist do?</h4>
								<p>A quality assurance specialist is responsible for managing, performing, and organising civilian testing for application deployments, performing quality assurance efforts on multiple application releases, and monitoring and documenting testing activities.</p>
								<h4>How is Shannon the quality assurance specialist for our project?</h4>
								<p>Sharon is responsible for the testing of our project. They’ve created a form that will be filled out by civilians who will be asked to test the project once it is finished. They will then analyse this feedback to determine what changes need to be made to create a better user experience and ensure the product is well received by the intended market.</p>

								<h3>Project manager/ad hoc duties– Marah</h3>
								<h4>What does a project manager do?</h4>
								<p>A project manager is responsible for overseeing software development and ensuring it runs smoothly by carefully planning, executing, and delegating tasks. Their primary concern is to predict risks, detect problems and respond appropriately to keep the project on track.</p>
								<h4>What are ad hoc duties?</h4>
								<p>Ad hoc duties are duties that emerge suddenly, usually because of difficulty. Ad hoc work obligations are special to a particular occasion, event, or period. (“What Are Ad Hoc Duties? (With Definition, Benefits and Tips)”)</p>
								<h4>How does Marah take on this role for our project? </h4>
								<p>Marah is responsible for overseeing the software development by checking in with team members and ensuring there are physical deliverables available. She checks in with everyone to ensure they can get their parts done and helps with research and asking other members to help where needed. She also gives feedback on aspects of the project for improvement before the final testing that will be done by civilian testers.</p>
