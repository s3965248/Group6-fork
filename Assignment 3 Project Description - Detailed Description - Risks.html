			<tr>
			  <th>Risk</th>
			  <th>Impact</th>
			  <th>Mitigation</th>
			  
		
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
			  <td><strong>
				Lack of Time   
				</strong></td>
			  <td> This may happen if the team underestimates the amount of time needed for parts of the projects. Unplanned obstacles such as sickness or team members quitting can also significantly affect the timeframe for app development.  

				This can result in the production of a low-quality or infeasible application.  </td>
			  <td> A thorough timeline would need to be implemented at the start of the project, to ensure all tasks and any potential setbacks are accounted for. In the case of unforeseen obstacles such as sickness of a team member, there should be a process in place to redistribute the workload.  
				</td>
				
			 
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td><strong>
					Lack of Skill    
				  </strong></td>
				<td> Building this app requires knowledge in languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The team also needs experience in utilising React and building Wireframes. As most members of our team are relatively new and inexperienced in IT, there may be some difficulty encountered using the software/hardware.  
				   </td>
				<td> Team members should be allocated roles that they have knowledge of and that would best suit their abilities. Members may also need to invest their own time in becoming more proficient in the software that they are using or seek help from other members/tutors. Some compromises may also be needed in terms of the final product that can be delivered.  
				  </td>
				  
			   
			  </tr>

			  <tr>
				<td><strong>
					Poor UX/ UI 				  </strong></td>
				<td>The graphical user interface (GUI) is a key factor in attracting and retaining more users to the app. An unappealing and complex interface would lead to users having difficulty accessing the app's functionalities.  
				   </td>
				<td> Wireframes can be made and tested to receive feedback regarding the user interface in the initial part of the app development. This will ensure that the GUI is user-friendly.  
				  </td>
				  
			   
			  </tr>
	  
			</tr>

			<tr>
			  <td><strong>
				Too many functions 				</strong></td>
			  <td> f the app has many functions this may be very time-consuming to develop and deliver. In addition to this, an overload of functionalities can confuse and overwhelm users. 
				 </td>
			  <td> Focus on key features of the app to deliver and remove any unnecessary features that do not contribute to the key aim of the app. Additional functionality can be rolled out in later releases. 
				</td>
				
			 
			</tr>
	
			
		</tr>

		<tr>
		  <td><strong>
			Lack of end-user engagement  			</strong></td>
		  <td> A lack of end-user engagement after app deployment results in the loss of time and money invested in creating the app.  
			 </td>
		  <td> 
			To ensure the app is created with the customers' needs in mind it is vital to conduct thorough initial user testing and analysis to see what customers are looking for. It is also important to conduct testing on the key demographic that the app is targeted towards to get meaningful results.  
			</td>
			
		 
		</tr>


	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><strong>
		Security Breaches 		</strong></td>
	  <td>
		Cyber Security breaches can lead to sensitive user data being compromised. 
		 </td>
	  <td> 
		Measures should be taken to ensure that the data is kept in secure databases. 
		</td>
