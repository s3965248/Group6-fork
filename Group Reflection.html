				 <h2>Shared Team Reflection</h2>
				 <p>As a team we believe that we utilised Microsoft Teams very well. We used the application not only to hold meetings but also to communicate with one another in between meetings for clarification, asking for and providing help, informing each other when work had been done, and many other things. We feel that communication was something we did extremely well throughout the time we’ve been working on our project; everyone was respectful to each other and very helpful when needed. </p>
				 <p>We all think that we started on our project a little late, having had our first meeting a few days after putting the team together rather than jumping right in. We plan to make an earlier start on the next project, aiming to begin as soon as this project has been submitted for marking. Another issue we had was not being specific enough about our timeline and deadlines for parts of the project. We were only planning out ranges for when parts should be done rather than setting specific dates and posting our progress for the entire team to see. We also hope to improve on our meetings in the next project as throughout this project our meeting were very short and didn’t involve as much brainstorming as we would have liked. Lastly, we would like to improve on our responsiveness in the posts on Microsoft Teams, posts asking for opinions or advice should preferably be answered by all team members for clarification and to make sure all members are on the same page and in agreement at all times. </p>
				 <p>We were all pleasantly surprised at how open and quick all the members of our team were to volunteer for work, there was never a time where something needed to be done and nobody was willing to take on the work. </p>
				 <p>We learned that when working in a group with strangers, that we only found through a discussion board on canvas, we had to go into it with an open mind. We couldn’t judge each other by the few posts we may have seen each other make on the discussion boards throughout the weeks before starting our team project. We were all very pleasantly surprised getting to know each other over the past few weeks and can only hope that as we get to know each other even more over the next few weeks we become and even stronger team. </p>

				 <h2>Marah's Reflection </h2>
				 <p>I feel we were very lucky to get a team full of members that are very motivated and more than ready to take on their fair share of the work and more. We did a very good job with communication and problem solving although we didn’t really have any major problems. Our biggest problem was probably just members getting sick and being unable to attend meetings and even everyone was great at communicating their inability to attend and others were very quick to step up to help if needed.  </p>
				 <p>Mostly we worked very well as a team, but our initial start time, collaboration, and deadline setting could’ve used a little improvement. I believe that if we collaborated a little better and uploaded our respective works earlier, we could’ve created a better project. </p>
				 <p>I was very surprised at how ready all the members were to take on work in the project. I’d always been used to there being at least one member in group work unwilling to put in their fair share. </p>
				 <p>Throughout this project I’ve learned that every group is different and not every experience is going to be identical to previous or future ones in that regard. </p>

				 <h2>Jordan's Reflection </h2>
				 <p>I think that we were lucky to get a good group of members, everyone is very motivated and ready to do their share of the project. I feel like communication has been a strong suit, any time a member was sick or unable to attend a meeting it was always communicated to the rest of the group. All group members were willing to take on extra work if someone needed help or something wasn't getting completed. </p>
				 <p>I think the only area we struggled with was starting the assignment a little late and I think with our next assignment we just need to start off a little stronger although we were still able to pull together and finish this assignment.</p>
				 <p>One thing that surprised me is everyone's willingness to take on extra work whenever any extra work came up in our meetings. None of the members in our group hesitated to take on extra work or help other team members.</p>
				 <p>Something that I've learned about working in groups is that good communication is a key part and although were all doing this remotely, I feel like the communication in this group is really good and I can't wait to start the next project.</p>

				 <h2>Shannon's Reflection </h2>
				 <p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that all group members were engaged with the project. Every time someone could not attend a meeting, they let the group know beforehand and reviewed the minutes and recording afterwards. When tasks came up, there was always someone willing to put their hand up to complete them. All team members were respectful in their communication with each other, which was heartening to see considering that we represent a diverse range of ages, backgrounds and genders. </p>
				 <p>For our next assignment, I believe we should dive right in. As this assignment nears the due date, it is easy to see that the few days before our initial meeting about this project were needed to complete the website and report to a high standard. Beginning immediately would also have allowed more time to review one another’s work in more detail and deepen creative collaboration. </p>
				 <p>From this experience I’ve learned that groups work best when they have clear shared expectations and processes. For the areas where we had these, such as agreed upon deadlines, things went smoothly. But for areas where we did not, such as setting a shared expectation for commenting on posts in the group Teams, it turned out that each team-mate had very different assumptions about how to proceed.  </p>
				 <p>I look forward to building on our strengths together in the next assignment.  </p>

				 <h2>Matthew's Reflection </h2>
				 <p>I was quite happy that all the members of the group were very steered toward completing the project to its fullest, with communication being done skilfully and efficiently. Every time in the past when I have been needed to work in a group it was always a struggle to get ideas together and to have proper communication with teammates, so I was thrilled to have a great team with proper communication. What could be improved next time is when we start, we started later then we should have and should’ve had a more detailed schedule when it came to planning the project.</p>
	       			 <p>One thing I learnt about working in a group is to keep an open mind about everything, we don’t know the situation the person is in and have no right to judge them based upon it, we don’t have the full story of what is happening.</p>
	       			 <p>I am sure that we will do better on the next assignment now we know how to work together.</p>

				 <h2>Anna's Reflection</h2>
				 <p> This group assignment has been a novel experience for me as I have not previously done group work through pureley online means. Initially, I was worried it would be difficult to communicate with the other members and it would be hard to set up meeting times as everyone worked at different times. However, the team members were all pretty felible and accomodating.  </p>
                                 <p> I also found the Micorosoft teams channel was a pretty effective tool in corresponding with the other team members. Although, sometime it is hard to sort through the channel as there are many post. This may be helped if we can find better remote working tools to help faciltiate our team work and maybe sort post according to category. </p>
                                 <p> I found that the group was easy to communicate with and the other members were all ready to take own their fair share of the work. For our next assignment it may be better if we are able to properly outline all tasks required of the assigment and assign to each memeber at the first meeting. For our next assignment it may also be worth aslo sending out agendas for meeting a few days early so that everyone member is able to come prepared with ideas to ensure everyone contributes during meetings. </p>
