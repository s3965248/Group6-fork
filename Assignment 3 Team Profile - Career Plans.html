                 <p>All of our team members aspire to work in the I.T. industry in the future. These jobs all require technical I.T. skills such as programming and software testing. Verbal/written communication and teamwork skills are also highly desirable for these roles as they require collaborating with other clients and team members. Time management is also an essential skill to have for all the ideal jobs require working on projects that often have deadlines.</p>
                 <p> Most of the members in our team are intending to pursue roles in web development (Shannon, Matthew and Anna). On the other hand, Jordan and Marah are aiming to become a software developer and software engineer respectively.</p>
                 <p>While all the roles require knowledge of programming, web development primarily focuses on web languages and requires knowledge of responsive web design as well. A game developer is also expected to have knowledge of graphic design, animation, and storytelling to assist in creating high quality games. The skills required for a software engineer and software developer overlap. However, software engineers utilize engineering principles to build software and systems. On the other hand, developers work on the development and implementation of software. They are more involved with consulting clients, conducting research and doing testing. </p>
                 <p>To achieve a pathway into their ideal jobs, Matthew, Marah and Jordan are intending to pursue and Bachelor in I.T. or computer science to further develop their skills and provide them with the qualifications to be hired into junior/entry level roles.  Both Shannon and Anna plan to utilise online resources to continue to develop their skills in web languages as well as putting their skills into action by working on their own projects.</p>
