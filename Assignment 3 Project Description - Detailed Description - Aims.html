								<h2>Detailed Description - Aims</h2>
								<p>The aim of Plantr is to give plant enthusiasts a platform to connect with others that have the same interests and create a gifting economy for plants. Plantr will provide its users with the opportunity to swap plants in a way that promotes community building. Users will be able to trade cuttings, full grown plants, and seedlings with each other. </p>
								<h3>Goals:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>
										<li>To be able to swap plants with others in the local area – We want users to be able to find and interact with plant enthusiasts in their local area. This will help our customers meet likeminded people as well as swap plants with as little hassle as possible. We plan to do this by creating a ‘listings’ page which will list the plants added by other users ordered by distance away from the current location of the user.</li>
										<li>To add metadata to these plants to make them discoverable – Our goal is for the Plantr app to include tags to plants added by users to make them more easily discoverable by other users looking for specific plants or aspects of plants for example seedling vs full grown plants or rose vs daisy etc. This feature will make it much simpler for users to find exactly what they’re looking for quickly without having to sort through plants they’re not interested in.</li>
										<li>To email other users to swap plants – Plantr will include an email feature that allows users to email each other securely without having their private information revealed to other users. This will make it more secure for users to communicate with each other to discuss their swap and organise how they will make the trade.</li>
										<li>To create a profile page – This enables users to create a unique identity on the app. This will promote use of the app as users will become more invested in the app if they feel a part of it. This will also enable users to build community by finding like-minded people who share a key interest in their local area. </li>
