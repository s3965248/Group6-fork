								<h2>What does it do? </h2>
       					<p>Cloud computing in simplest terms refers to a collection of networks. It is a model that enables remote access of range of pooled computing resources such as networks servers, storage, service and applications. The benefit of cloud computing is that the user does not have to invest in their own infrastructure but instead can utilize a mediator to provide computing service. Many businesses and organizations increasingly use cloud computing in their daily operations as it can be more efficient and help to create smoother workflows.  </p>
								<p>Cloud computing implements virtualization technology which allows software to perform hardware computer functions. Application virtualization is a form of virtualization which allow may users to access and application that is hosted one machine. Due to scalability of this as the application can be shared by many users, this also reduces the cost. The other basic type of virtualization is server virtualization. This enables the use of one physical server and its hardware, to host multiple virtual servers. Consequentially, this creates less of a need for physical hardware and can reduce special needs and maintenance costs. Due to needing less hardware, this can also provide environmental benefits resources and electricity is required.</p>
								<h2>Types of Cloud Computing Service Models </h2>

								<h3>Software as a Service (SaaS) </h3>
								<p>Software as a service offers applications over the internet. This includes applications such a sales, project management tools and file storage. Examples of SaaS providers include Slack, Dropbox and Google Workplace. </p>

								<h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  </h3>
								<p>Infrastructure as a service provides date centre infrastructure. IaaS provides a storage, servers, and networking hardware. This reduces costs for users by allowing them to forego setting up on-site infrastructure. Examples of IaaS providers are Linode and Amazon Web Services. </p>

								<h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS) </h3>
								<p>Platform as a service provides users a platform to develop and deploy applications. PaaS includes infrastructure similar to IaaS but additionally also includes middleware and operating systems Developers can access their projects remotely through the web as the project is hosted on the cloud. This tool allows for global collaboration and increases efficiency.  Examples od PaaS providers include Google App Engine and OpenShift. </p>

								<h2> Cloud Computing Trends </h2>
								<p>Cloud computing has increased in demand due to workplace shifts caused by the pandemic. According to Gartner, the global cloud revenue for 2022 was estimated to be $408 Billion, marking 64 billion increase from 2021. As businesses and organisations continue to adopt cloud computing to onboard new workloads, Gartner predicts that cloud revenue will surpass non cloud revenue</p>
								<p>Cloud computing has increased in demand due to workplace shifts caused by the pandemic. According to a Gartner report from 2021, the global cloud revenue for 2022 was estimated to be $408 Billion, marking 64 billion increases from 2021. As businesses and organisations continue to adopt cloud computing, Gartner predicts that cloud revenue will surpass non cloud revenue Gartner estimates that approximately 85% of organisation will shift to cloud-first approach by 2025. This further implies that application development will become redundant with businesses focusing on application assembly and integration. The applications will be assembled and composed by the teams that use them. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 70% of applications will be developed using no-code or low-code technologies.  This will lead to a shift in in business to a more product-orientated operating model.  </p>

								<h2>Impact of Cloud Computing</h2>
								<h4>Pros</h4>
								<p>-	Increased Scalability:  As companies do not have to invest in their own hardware, this allows them to scale up or down according to user needs. </p>
								<p>-	Reduce Costs: Cloud services are typically paid through subscriptions and are able to cancel their subscriptions if no longer in need of the service. Companies do not have pay for their own infrastructure, software licenses and maintenance.  </p>
								<p>-	Increased efficiency and flexibility: Companies can access cloud services on demand when they need it and cancel when they don’t. </p>

								<h4>Cons</h4>
								<p>-	Compromised Security: Although cloud storage services are advertised as secure by providers, it is still susceptible to breaches and thus may lead to leak of confidential/personal data. </p>
       					<p>-	Decreased Administrative control: As cloud services providers manage and maintain the data, it may be more difficult to view, access and amend data compared to maintaining own data. </p>
       					<p>-     Internet Reliance and Latency:  As cloud services need the internet to function, this makes it inaccessible if there is no connection. Poor broadband width may also cause delays in data being updated. </p>

       					<h2> How will this affect you?  </h2>
       					<p> As more individuals become connected to the internet, the use of cloud services will continue to rise. With access to the cloud individuals would also be able to access a much larger range of resources for that they may not have access to locally. Increasingly complex applications will be able to be completed on smart devices. However, with the increasing presence of the cloud in everyday life this may also lead to the susceptibly of privacy and security. As more date is stored in the cloud it may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Another impact of cloud services becoming more pervasive in business, is the redundancy of employees that manage and maintain hardware for companies. Simultaneously, this would also open up new roles that focus on cloud services.</p>
